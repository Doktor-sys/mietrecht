## Executive Summary

The task migration from the legacy tasks.md file to Asana is underway. We have successfully extracted 28 tasks from the markdown file and converted them into a structured format suitable for import into Asana.

## Progress Overview

### Completed Activities
- Extracted tasks from tasks.md using custom parser script
- Converted tasks to structured JSON and CSV formats
- Analyzed task attributes and dependencies
- Prepared import templates

### Current Activities
- Reviewing extracted tasks for accuracy
- Mapping task attributes to Asana custom fields
- Preparing import files for Asana

### Upcoming Activities
- Import tasks into Asana
- Establish task dependencies
- Assign tasks to team members
- Validate imported tasks

## Task Statistics

## Next Steps

1. Review extracted tasks for data quality and completeness
2. Map task attributes to Asana custom fields:
   - Priority → Priority dropdown
   - Estimate → Estimate number field
   - Owner → Assignee
   - Dependencies → Task dependencies
3. Create import templates for Asana
4. Import tasks in batches
5. Validate imported tasks and dependencies

## Notes

The extraction process revealed that many tasks in the original tasks.md file were already marked as completed. This indicates the project has substantial progress already made. The migration will focus on preserving this history while establishing proper tracking in Asana.
