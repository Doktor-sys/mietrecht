# Task Management Quick Start Guide

This guide provides a quick reference for using the new task management system.

## Reading Tasks

Each task now includes several key pieces of information:

```
- [ ] **Task Title** (Prio: High | Est: 3 days | Owner: John | Depends on: Previous Task):
    - Task description
    - Acceptance Criteria (for complex tasks):
        - Specific requirement 1
        - Specific requirement 2
```

### Task Attributes Explained

- **Prio**: Priority level (Critical, High, Medium, Low)
- **Est**: Estimated effort in person-days
- **Owner**: Person or team responsible for completion
- **Depends on**: Prerequisite tasks that must be completed first

## Creating New Tasks

When adding new tasks, follow this template:

```
### Category Name
- [ ] **Descriptive Task Title** (Prio: Priority | Est: Estimate | Owner: Assignee | Depends on: Prerequisites): 
    - Brief description of what needs to be accomplished
    - Acceptance Criteria (for complex tasks):
        - Measurable outcome 1
        - Measurable outcome 2
        - Measurable outcome 3
```

### Priority Guidelines

- **Critical**: Must be done immediately; blocks other work
- **High**: Important for current goals; should be done soon
- **Medium**: Part of regular workflow
- **Low**: Nice to have; can be deferred

## Updating Task Status

Use these status indicators:

- ✅ Completed - Work is finished and meets acceptance criteria
- 🚧 In Progress - Actively being worked on
- 📋 Planned/Backlog - Scheduled for future work
- ⏸️ Paused/Blocked - Cannot progress due to external factors

## Daily Standup Format

During standups, each team member should report:

1. **Yesterday**: What I accomplished
2. **Today**: What I plan to work on
3. **Blockers**: Anything preventing progress

Example:
- Yesterday: Completed the authentication service unit tests
- Today: Starting work on the document storage integration
- Blockers: Waiting for database access credentials

## Weekly Grooming Sessions

Every Monday, we review:

1. Update task priorities based on current needs
2. Re-estimate efforts based on progress
3. Identify and resolve blockers
4. Assign new tasks to team members
