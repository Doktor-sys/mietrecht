| Report Configuration | Not Started | Dependent on data availability |
| Workflow Automation | Not Started | Requires completed task setup |

## Next Steps

1. **Immediate (This Week)**
   - Obtain necessary access credentials for integrations
   - Coordinate with team leads on specific requirements
   - Begin GitHub integration setup
   - Start initial dashboard framework

2. **Short-term (Next 2 Weeks)**
   - Complete GitHub integration and testing
   - Implement Slack integration
   - Configure calendar integration
   - Create basic project dashboards

3. **Medium-term (Next Month)**
   - Set up automated reporting
   - Implement workflow automations
   - Conduct team training on integrated features
   - Gather and incorporate feedback

## Resource Requirements

### Access Requirements
- GitHub repository access with admin privileges
- Slack workspace admin access
- Team calendar access and permissions
- Asana admin credentials

### Time Investment
- Initial setup: 20-25 hours
- Ongoing configuration: 10-15 hours
- Team training: 8-10 hours
- Optimization and feedback: 15-20 hours

## Success Metrics

### Short-term Metrics (2 weeks)
- GitHub integration functional
- Slack notifications configured
- Basic dashboards created
- Team aware of integration plans

### Medium-term Metrics (1 month)
- All tool integrations operational
- Reporting dashboards active
- Basic workflow automations implemented
- Positive team feedback on integration benefits

### Long-term Metrics (2 months)
- 80%+ team adoption of integrated workflows
- 50% reduction in manual status updates
- 90% of routine tasks automated
- Improved project visibility and reporting

## Risks and Mitigation

### Technical Risks
- **Integration compatibility issues**: Test integrations in staging environment first
- **Performance impacts**: Monitor system performance during and after integration
- **Data synchronization problems**: Implement validation checks and error handling

### Organizational Risks
- **Team resistance to new tools**: Communicate benefits clearly and provide comprehensive training
- **Workflow disruption during transition**: Implement changes gradually with team feedback
- **Insufficient adoption**: Provide ongoing support and showcase success stories

## Support Plan

### Documentation
- Integration user guides for each tool
- Troubleshooting documentation
- Best practices for integrated workflows

### Training
- Hands-on workshops for complex integrations
- Quick reference guides for daily use
- Video tutorials for remote team members

### Ongoing Support
- Dedicated support channel for integration questions
- Weekly office hours for hands-on assistance
- Direct contact for critical issues

## Notes

The workflow integration is designed to enhance rather than disrupt existing processes. All integrations will be implemented with a focus on improving team efficiency and project visibility while maintaining the flexibility to adjust based on team feedback.
