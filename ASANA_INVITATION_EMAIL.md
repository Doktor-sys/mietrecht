Dear Team,

I'm excited to announce that we're transitioning to Asana as our primary task and project management platform. Asana will help us streamline our workflows, improve collaboration, and maintain better visibility into our project progress.

**Why Asana?**
- Real-time collaboration on tasks and projects
- Clear visibility into who's working on what
- Automated notifications and reminders
- Integration with tools we already use (GitHub, Slack)
- Mobile access for on-the-go updates

**What You Need to Do:**
1. Look for an invitation email from Asana (invitations@asana.com) in your inbox
2. Click the "Accept Invitation" button in the email
3. Create your Asana account using the same email address
4. Download the mobile app if you'd like to access Asana on your phone

**Getting Started:**
- We'll be holding an introduction meeting to walk through Asana's features and our specific setup
- In the meantime, you can explore the Asana Guide: https://asana.com/guide

**Support:**
If you encounter any issues during the setup process or have questions about Asana, please don't hesitate to reach out:
- For technical issues: Contact IT Support at it@jurismind.de
- For process questions: Contact me at max@jurismind.de
- For Asana-specific questions: Visit https://asana.com/support

We're making this transition to improve our team's efficiency and collaboration. I appreciate your patience as we work through this change together.

Please let me know how I can help, or if you've already set up your account and I missed updating our tracking sheet.
